# Linear-Regression-Demo

This project applies Linear Regression on the Boston Housing dataset to predict median home values based on features like crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, and socio-economic indicators. It includes data loading, exploratory analysis, model training with scikit-learn, evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ², and visualizations comparing predicted vs actual values, providing a clear end-to-end demonstration of regression modeling in Python.
